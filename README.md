So far I have been working on movement and shooting and enemy and player interactions.

Will add a few more enemy types than just homing, like a turret type that is stationary and fires shots and an enemy that randomly moves around the screen. I think we also randomly assign a homing vs random movement
<br> script to different enemies as they are spawned into the level.

To work on:
<br>Collisions with walls and obstacles
<br>Enemies will somewhat manuever around obstacles if they are homing enemies instead of the just walking into them
<br>Y'all can add whatever else you want to here
